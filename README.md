# Classifying-Emotion-with-Deep-Learning
### Problem Statement 
Emotion classification with deep learning has become a more contemporary topic in the machine learning age. There are many approaches to emotion classification with neural networks, but I wanted to see if I could classify emotion using both MFCCs and melspectograms; both are visualizations of audio files. 

### Data 
The data I used for this project is the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song. There are 2000+ audio files in the database of actors and actresses singing and speaking two different phrases in eight different emotions. Go to https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.XT5sat-YU5k for a free download of the dataset.
